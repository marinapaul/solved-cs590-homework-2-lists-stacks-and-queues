1. Design, and implement two algorithms to remove duplicates from an unsorted single Linked-List. Youare given the implementation of the single Linked-List in the files LinkedList.h, and LinkedList.cpp. You arealso given the skeleton code in problem1.cpp where you will implement the requested solution. A testcase has been provided in the main() function, but feel free to write additional test cases to make sureyour code works. (Additional test cases are not requested, and will not be graded).a) for the first algorithm, you can use an additional data structure (one of the STL containers â€“you can add one include to the header file for that container of the STL you decide to use)b) for the second algorithm, no additional data structure can be used2. Design, and implement a C++ class that implements the queue data structure, using two stacks. For thestacks, you are allowed to use the stacks implementation of C++ STL, already included in the source codeshared with you. In the problem2.cpp file you will find a skeleton of the code where you have to implementthe requested solution. A test case has been provided in the main() function, but feel free to writeadditional test cases to make sure your code works. (Additional test cases are not requested, and will notbe graded).
